# Structurator

## Project Description

Structurator is a Python tool designed to automate the creation of a predefined directory and file structure based on a JSON description. It also generates a diagram representing this structure and saves it in a `diagram.md` file.

## Features

1. **Read Structure from JSON File**:
   - The script reads the directory and file structure from a JSON file specified by the user via the command line.

2. **Create Directories and Files**:
   - The script creates the specified directories and files without overwriting existing ones.

3. **Generate Structure Diagram**:
   - The script generates a diagram representing the directory and file structure and saves it in a `diagram.md` file at the project root.
